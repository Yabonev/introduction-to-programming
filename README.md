# What is this?
A complementary github repository for the [videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZLfb3G_cLRzqlwmO1LqMBPm71yESU3M1?usp=sharing) I upload for the `Introduction to Programming` course in the faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University. There is a backlog in the [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJhs29Bkjn7rbrxkCdMtQD8qPoSH8-uYzLaM-0nEOxI/edit?usp=sharing) in which you can see what is done and what might be added in the near future.

# How to use this repository
I'd suggest commiting to a time frame of 30-60m to introduce yourself to what I've done, check some videos, look around the repository, read the notes, the backlog and after doing the research decide whether all of this is worth your time or not.

# Structure
TODO: add structure, after one makes sense.

# Get involved
If you're here, you're probably studying Introduction to Programming in FMI. Your opinion and support are **invaluable**. You can add your suggestions in the [notes docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJhs29Bkjn7rbrxkCdMtQD8qPoSH8-uYzLaM-0nEOxI/edit?usp=sharing). You can also show your support by starring this repository, so I have an idea how much people I am working with.
